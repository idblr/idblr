I was a co-author on a poster entitled "Comparing the association of self-reported race-ethnicity and genetic ancestry with all-cause mortality: A pan-cancer survivor analysis in the PLCO Screening Trial" at the [14th AACR Conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved](https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-virtual-conference-14th-aacr-conference-on-the-science-of-cancer-health-disparities-in-racial-ethnic-minorities-and-the-medically-underserved/) by [Derek Brown, PhD, MS](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8393-1713) and [Jacqueline Vo, PhD, RN, MPH](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8891-4437) held virtually due to the global [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) pandemic. This effort was funded by our [2021 William G. Coleman Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Innovation Award](/post/coleman-2021).
