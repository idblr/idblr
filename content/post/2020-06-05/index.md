I gave an invited talk at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) entitled "A place for spatial analysis in the Cancer Control Continuum." The talk was an overview of my work in progress over the past year in the [Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/). The talk was recorded, so please [contact me](/profile) if you are interested in viewing the talk.
