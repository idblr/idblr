I presented my invited talk entitled "Estimating environmental mixtures in a geospatial context" in a symposium entitled "Implementing geolocation-based exposure assessments" at the [Society for Epidemiologic Reserach 2021](https://epiresearch.org/annual-meeting/2021-meeting/) annual meeting held virtually due to the global [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) pandemic.
