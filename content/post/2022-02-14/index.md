I received a 2021 [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) (NCI) [Director's Award for Emerging Leader]() along with the other members of the Fellows Advisory Board of the [Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) (CPFP) in recognition of spearheading innovative opportunities for fellows to develop skills and community during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were nominated by the CPFP Director, [Lisa Signorello, ScD, ScM](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0904-6350), and were the only recipients of a 2021 NCI Director's Award within the [Division of Cancer Prevention](https://prevention.cancer.gov/) (DCP).
