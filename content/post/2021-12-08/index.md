I first authored an invited commentary in the [American Journal of Epidemiology](https://academic.oup.com/aje) entitled ["Invited Commentary: Predicting incidence rates of rare cancers: adding epidemiologic and spatial contexts"](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab285). My co-author, [Dr. Rena Jones](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/jones-rena), and I commented on [Salmerón et al. (2021a)](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab262) estimation of county-level incidences rates of rare cancers in Europe. [Salmerón et al. (2021b)](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab286) responded to our invited commentary. This is my first published invited commentary and my first publication in the [American Journal of Epidemiology](https://academic.oup.com/aje).
