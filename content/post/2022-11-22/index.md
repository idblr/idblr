I co-authored an article in [Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/) entitled ["Geographic Patterns in U.S. Lung Cancer Mortality and Cigarette Smoking"](https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-22-0253) led by [Alaina Shreves](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0127-4391) and [Dr. Rena Jones](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1294-1679). We applied geospatial statistical methods to describe patterns in lung cancer mortality rates (2005-2018) in relation to patterns in cigarette smoking prevalences (1997-2003) by sex at the US county level. Our findings identified counties where lung carcinogens other than smoking may be driving lung cancer mortality and where further study is needed. You can find the [R langauge](https://cran.r-project.org/) scripts to recreate the manuscript figures in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/idblr/geo_US_lung_cancer_and_smoking).

**Update** - 2023-02-06: Manuscript published in [Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/) [Volume 32 Issue 2](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/issue/32/2)
