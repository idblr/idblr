I co-authored a commentary in the [*Epidemiology*](http://www.epidem.com/) entitled ["Advancing reproducible research through version control technology"](https://doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0000000000001845) led by [Dr. Ghassan Hamra](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6921-5742). We introduce version control and explain why we believe all epidemiologists should use it within their workflows to support reproducible research. This is my first published non-invited commentary.
