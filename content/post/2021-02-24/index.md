I presented a lightning talk entitled "Geographic Variation in the Oral Microbiome of NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study Participants" at a [National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/) workshop entitled [Impact of Environmental Exposures on the Microbiome and Human Health](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/events/pastmtg/2021/ieemhh_2021/index.cfm) held virtually due to the global [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) pandemic.
