I co-authored an article in the [Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology](https://www.nature.com/jes/) entitled ["Association between solar radiation and mood disorders among Gulf Coast residents"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-024-00691-w) led by [Dr. Xinlei Deng](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8129-6007). We assessed the potential relationship between multiple mental health outcomes (mood disorders: depression and distress) and multiple windows of exposure to solar radiation (7-, 14-, and 30-days prior to home visit) for participants within the [Gulf Long-Term Follow-up Study](https://gulfstudy.nih.gov/en/index.html). We linked [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) (ORNL) [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) data to participant residential addresses at home visit. Using adjusted generalized linear mixed models we observed higher levels of 7-days prior solar radiation exposure were associated with lower levels of mood disorders. This is my first peer-reviewed publication as an Epidemiologist at [DLH Corporation](https://www.dlhcorp.com).
