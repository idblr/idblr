I co-authored an article in the [*Journal of the National Cancer Institute*](https://academic.oup.com/jnci) entitled ["Ethylene oxide emissions and incident breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a U.S. cohort"](https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djad004) led by [Dr. Rena Jones](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1294-1679). We constructed two GIS-based exposure metrics of ethylene oxide (EtO) from the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov) [Toxics Release Inventory](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program) to estimate the risk of incident breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the  [NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study](https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/nih-aarp-diet-health-study). We observed an increased risk of breast cancer associated with EtO-emitting facilities within 10 kilometers of residence (stronger for *in situ* than invasive disease) and higher risk of breast cancer *in situ* in top exposure quartiles. No differences in breast cancer risk were observed by tumor estrogen receptor status and we found no clear pattern of increased NHL risk.
