I will be taking over Dr. Joseph Shearer's project entiled "Evaluating the impact of concentrated animal feeding operations on *Campylobacter jejuni* infections in rural agricultural communities" as he is departing the NCI. The project is funded by a 2020 [National Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/) [William G.
