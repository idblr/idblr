I co-authored an article in the [Journal of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Statistics](https://www.springer.com/journal/13253) entitled ["A Shared Latent Process Model to Correct for Preferential Sampling in Disease Surveillance Systems"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-023-00535-4) led by [Dr. Brian Conroy](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3329-0828). We designed an approach to address preferential sampling in infectious disease surveillance that incorporates both locational and disease-related components. The locational component describes the spatial pattern of sampled locations in terms of a latent spatial process, which is shared with the disease-related component of the model that describes the abundances of disease positive and negative specimens. We used a simulation-based study and a real-world case study of wildlife rodent specimen in California, U.S.A., to compare our proposed method against two conventional infectious disease surveillance methods. Our proposed method identified the focal high-risk areas and large low-risk areas (e.g., Central Valley) of plague better than the two benchmark methods.
