I received an [Informatics Tool Challenge Award](https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/news/2020/informatics) from the NCI [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/) for a project entitled "sparrpowR: A flexible R package and webtool to estimate statistical power of a spatial cluster detection technique." My co-Principal Investigator, [Dr. Derek Brown](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/about-us/cpfp-fellow/derek-brown) (DCEG/OEEB), is another postdoctoral [Cancer Prevention Fellow](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) and we are joined by our supervisors [Dr. Rena Jones](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/jones-rena) (DCEG/OEEB) and [Dr. Mitch Machiela](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/machiela-mitchell) (DCEG/ITEB), respectively, as well as Dr. Tim Myers (DCEG/ITEB). The funds ($20,000) will be used by the NCI [Center for Biomedical Informatics \& Information Technology](https://datascience.cancer.gov/) to develop a web application of our R package called [sparrpowR](https://github.com/machiela-lab/sparrpowR) *in development*.
