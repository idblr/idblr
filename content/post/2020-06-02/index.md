I received an [Informatics Tool Challenge Award](https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/news/2020/2020-informatics-tool-challenge) from the NCI [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/) for a project entitled "sparrpowR: A flexible R package and webtool to estimate statistical power of a spatial cluster detection technique." My co-Principal Investigator, [Derek Brown, Ph.D., M.S.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/iteb/brown-derek) (DCEG/OEEB), is another postdoctoral [Cancer Prevention Fellow](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) and we are joined by our supervisors [Rena Jones, Ph.D., M.S.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/jones-rena) (DCEG/OEEB) and [Mitch Machiela, Sc.D., M.P.H.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/machiela-mitchell) (DCEG/ITEB), respectively, as well as Tim Myers (DCEG/ITEB). The funds ($20,000) will be used by the NCI [Center for Biomedical Informatics \& Information Technology](https://datascience.cancer.gov/) to develop a web application of our R package called [sparrpowR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sparrpowR/index.html).

**Update**: [Spatial Power](https://analysistools.cancer.gov/spatial-power) was successfully launched on May 20, 2021
