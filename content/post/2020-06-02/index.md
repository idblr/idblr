I received an [Informatics Tool Challenge Award](https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/news/2020/2020-informatics-tool-challenge) from the NCI [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/) for a project entitled "sparrpowR: A flexible R package and webtool to estimate statistical power of a spatial cluster detection technique." My co-Principal Investigator, [Dr. Derek Brown](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8393-1713) (DCEG/OEEB), is another postdoctoral [Cancer Prevention Fellow](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) and we are joined by our supervisors [Dr. Rena Jones](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1294-1679) (DCEG/OEEB) and [Dr. Mitch Machiela](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6538-9705) (DCEG/ITEB), respectively, as well as Tim Myers (DCEG/ITEB). The funds ($20,000) will be used by the NCI [Center for Biomedical Informatics \& Information Technology](https://datascience.cancer.gov/) to develop a web application of our R package called [*sparrpowR*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sparrpowR/index.html).

**Update #1**: [*sparrpowR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sparrpowR) was successfully published in the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) on June 10, 2020. [See more details](/post/cran-sparrpowR).

**Update #2**: [Spatial Power](https://analysistools.cancer.gov/spatial-power) was successfully launched on May 20, 2021. [See more details](/post/spatial-power).
