My first manuscript that was featured as the cover article of a scientific journal was published today in [Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/) [Volume 31, Issue 5](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/issue/31/5). I co-firsted authored the article entitled ["A National Map of NCI-Designated Cancer Center Catchment Areas on the 50th Anniversary of the Cancer Centers Program"](https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-1230) with [Peter DelNero, PhD, MPH](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8149-9004). The cover image is an artistically modified version of Figure 1 in the manuscript. You can find more details in a [previous post](/post/cebp-2022).
