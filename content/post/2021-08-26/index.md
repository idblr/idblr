I presented my oral abstract entitled "Roadway Proximity and Lung Cancer Risk in NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study Participants" at the [33rd Annual Conference of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology](https://www.isee2021.org/) held virtually due to the global [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) pandemic. I was also a co-author on three abstracts:

1. "Residential proximity to animal feeding operations and mortality among postmenopausal women in the Iowa Women’s Health Study" led by [Dr. Jessica Madrigal](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5303-5109)
2. "Residential proximity to animal feeding operations and risk of lymphohematopoietic cancers in the Iowa Women’s Health Study" led by [Dr. Jared Fisher](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9203-5742)
3. "Ethylene oxide emissions and risk of breast cancer and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a large U.S. cohort" led by [Dr. Rena Jones](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1294-1679)
