I co-first authored an article in [Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/) entitled ["A National Map of NCI-Designated Cancer Center Catchment Areas on the 50th Anniversary of the Cancer Centers Program"](https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-1230) with [Peter DelNero, PhD, MPH](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8149-9004). We geographically define and display a national map of 63 NCI-designated Cancer Center catchment areas as well as demonstrate how publicly available data sets can be linked to each catchment area. You can find the [R langauge](https://cran.r-project.org/) scipts to recreate the manuscript figures in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/idblr/NCI_Cancer_Center_Catchment_Areas). This is my first data product during my training as a [Cancer Prevention Fellow](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/).
