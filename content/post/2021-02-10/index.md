I co-authored an article in the [International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph) entitled ["Spatial Heterogeneity in Positional Errors: A Comparison of Two Residential Geocoding Efforts in the Agricultural Health Study"](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041637), which is included in the Special Issue [Spatial Data Uncertainty in Public Health Research](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/special_issues/Spatial_Uncertainty). The article identifies areas with positional error in residential addresses between two geocoding efforts compared to Geographic Positioning System recordings in the [Agricultural Health Study](https://aghealth.nih.gov/), a prospective cancer cohort of licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina. My contribution was the data visualization and spatial analysis of the positional error such as a weighted spatial density estimation of the positional error to identify areas of significant improvement in positional accuracy between geocoding efforts while protecting personally identifiable information.
