I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov) through the [Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program](https://cpfp.cancer.gov) working with [Dr. Rena Jones](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1294-1679) and [Dr. Mary Ward](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7584-8856) in the [Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/oeeb) in the [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov) in Rockville, Maryland. 

I am now an Epidemiologist at [DLH, LLC](https://www.dlhcorp.com), (formerly Social and Scientific Systems, Inc.) in Bethesda, Maryland.
