I received an annual Merit Award from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Prevention [Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) (CPFP) that recognizes scientific productivity, leadership, and
exemplary service to the CPFP, NCI, National Institutes of Health, and other outside organizations in cancer prevention. Three other postdoctoral Cancer Prevention Fellows also won an award this year: [Jacqueline Vo, Ph.D., R.N., M.P.H.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/reb/vo-jacqueline), [Derek Brown, Ph.D., M.S.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/iteb/brown-derek), and [Sydney O'Connor, Ph.D.](https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=33495932&name=Sydney-O%27Connor&bioType=flw)
