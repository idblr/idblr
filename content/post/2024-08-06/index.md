I co-first authored an article in [*BMC Cancer*](https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/) entitled ["Neighborhood-Level Deprivation and Survival in Lung Cancer"](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-024-12720-w) co-led with Dr. Kathleen Kennedy and [Dr. Ignacio Jusue-Torres](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9749-1912). We assessed the potential associations of neighborhood deprivation, DNA methylation, and lung cancer mortality in a multicenter retrospective cohort study. We found HOXA7 and DNA methylation were significantly correlated with neighborhood deprivation and participants residing in high-deprivation neighborhoods had a significantly shorter survival than those residing in low-deprivation neighborhoods. My largest contributions to the study was creating the [code companion](https://github.com/idblr/geomethylation) for the manuscript and designing, computing, and performing of the neighborhood deprivation index linkages to participant locations using the [*ndi*](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ndi) package in R that I [previously published](/post/cran-ndi).
