I co-authored an article in the [*Science of The Total Environment*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-the-total-environment) entitled ["Prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors associated with residential natural hazard risk"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2025.179335) led by [Dr. Kaitlyn Lawrence](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8360-9326). We assessed the potential relationship between CVD-related risk factors (i.e., diabetes, obesity, hypertension) and risk of natural hazards for participants within the [Gulf Long-Term Follow-up Study](https://gulfstudy.nih.gov/en/index.html). We linked the [Federal Emergency Management Agency ](https://www.fema.gov/) (FEMA) [National Risk Index](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/) (NRI) for Natural Hazards to participant residential addresses at home visit. We found that residing in areas prone to all or specific natural disasters is associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors.
