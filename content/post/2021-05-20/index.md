[Spatial Power](https://analysistools.cancer.gov/spatial-power) is a web application that calculates the power for spatial statistics. Currently, the tool has one module for the spatial relative risk function. [Dr. Derek Brown](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8393-1713) and I co-designed the web application with a development team from the NCI [Center for Biomedical Informatics & Information Technology](https://datascience.cancer.gov/). We received funding from a [DCEG Informatics Tool Challenge Award](/post/tools) and a [DCP Trans-Fellowship Research Award Supplement](/post/tfra-2021). Please [contact me](/profile) or [Dr. Brown](mailto:derek9@gwmail.gwu.edu) with any suggestions for improvements, especially additional spatial statistics you would like to see in the web application.
