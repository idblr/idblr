I gave an invited talk at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov) [Division of Cancer Prevention](https://prevention.cancer.gov/) [Multi-Cancer Detection](https://prevention.cancer.gov/major-programs/mcd) Working Group entitled "Accessible geospatial socio-economic metrics." The talk was an introduction to my open-source R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) named [ndi](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ndi) that I developed as a postdoctoral [Cancer Prevention Fellow](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/). The host, [Dr. Amanda Skarlupka](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3654-9076), performed a tutorial of the package and how it can be used for the evaluation and design of clinical trial recruitment.
