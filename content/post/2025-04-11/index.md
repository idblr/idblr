I co-authored an article in the [*International Journal of Health Geographics*](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/) entitled ["Geographic patterns in wildland fire exposures and county-level lung cancer mortality in the United States"](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-025-00394-x) led by [Dr. Richard Remigio](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8381-4728). We applied geospatial statistical methods to describe patterns in lung cancer mortality rates (2016-2020) in relation to patterns in various wildland fire metrics (1997-2003) by sex at the US county level after accounting cigarette smoking prevalences (1997-2003). Our findings identified counties outside the western US with wildfires associated with lung cancer mortalityand where further study is needed. This analysis used similar approaches to a previous co-authorship in [Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention Volume 32 Issue 2](/post/cebp-2022b).
