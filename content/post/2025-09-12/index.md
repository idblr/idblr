I co-instructed a workshop at the [NIH Research Festival](https://researchfestival.nih.gov/) 2025 entitled "Geospatial for Everyone: Enhancing Your “Non-spatial” Research with Geospatial Data" with [Dr. Nathaniel MacNell](https://orcid.org/0009-0007-9851-1376). In our [workshop](https://github.com/nathanielmacnell/nihworkshop), we presented an interactive open-source workflow of geographically linking publicly available data to simulated locations and demonstrated how these data can be used for clinical study design and analysis. We used the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/) (NHLBI) & [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) (NCI) [Neighborhood Deprivation Index](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108002) (NDI) throughout our examples, which is also calculated by my R package [_ndi_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ndi) (click [here](/post/cran-ndi) for more information). We were one of twenty-six vendor workshops held at the NIH Research Festival chosen out of hundreds of applicants.
