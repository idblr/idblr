I presented my abstract entitled "Geographic variation in the oral microbiome of Agricultural Health Study applicators" at the [Society for Epidemiologic Reserach 2020](https://epiresearch.org/annual-meeting/2020-meeting/) annual meeting held virtually due to the global [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) pandemic.
