I took over for [Dr. Sarah Jackson](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/iib/jackson-sarah) as Co-Editor-in-Chief of the DCEG Fellows Editorial Board (DFEB). I join [Dr. Maeve Bailey-Whyte](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/about-us/cpfp-fellow/maeve-bailey-whyte) in this role. DFEB is a fellow-led group that offers fellows a free scientific document-reviewing service and the opportunity to build scientific editing and review skills of their own. The group provides confidential, anonymous feedback on grammar, organization, and flow of scientific manuscripts, abstracts, proposals, posters, and slide decks.
