I presented a poster at the [Military Health System Research Symposium](https://mhsrs.health.mil) 2025 entitled "Open-source estimation of shade availability at military bases in the United States." I presented an initial workflow of estimating the shadow footprint (shade) of obstacles on United States (US) Military facilities using the US Naval Academy campus as an example. We use publicly-available [US Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov) [3D Elevation Program](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program) point cloud data with custom-built open-source software.
