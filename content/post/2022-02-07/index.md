I gave an invited talk at the Center for Science and Technology in the Radiation Protection Division of the Office of Air and Radiation of the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.cancer.gov/) entitled "Putting cancer and environmental exposures in (geo)spatial perspective." The talk was an overview of my work in progress over the past year in the [Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/).
