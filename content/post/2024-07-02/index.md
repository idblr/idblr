I co-authored an article in [*Science of the Total Environment*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-the-total-environment) entitled ["Residential air pollution, greenspace, and adverse mental health outcomes in the U.S. Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174434) led by [Dr. Emily Werder](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8757-6341). We assessed the potential relationship between multiple mental health outcomes (mood disorders: depression and distress) and exposure to ambient air pollution (annual average concentrations of particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter [PM<sub>2.5</sub>] and nitrogen dioxide [NO<sub>2</sub>]) and greenness (Enhanced Vegetation Index [EVI]) for participants within the [Gulf Long-Term Follow-up Study](https://gulfstudy.nih.gov/en/index.html). We linked [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov/) (NASA) [Sociodemographic Data and Applications Center](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/) (SEDAC) and [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod13.php) (MODIS) data to participant residential addresses at home visit. Using adjusted log-binomial regression we observed the highest level of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was associated with higher levels of depression. We also observed the highest level of greenness was associated with lower levels of depression and appears to mitigate the impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on depression. We also linked (and adjusted for) [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) (USDA) [Rural-urban commuting area codes](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/) (RUCA) and [Area Deprivation Index](https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/) (ADI) from the [University of Wisconsin](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/). My largest contribution to the study was designing and performing the majority of the data linkages.
