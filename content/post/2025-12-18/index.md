I presented a poster at the [American Geophysical Union](https://www.agu.org) [2025 Annual Meeting](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting) entitled "Temporal clustering of air pollution and heat wave events at domestic U.S. Military facilities." I presented initial results comparing three statistical approaches (supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches) to evaluate the potential relationship between heat and air pollution wave events at U.S. Military Facilities within 4 km of [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov) [Air Quality System](https://www.epa.gov/aqs) sampling locations. We also used publicly-available [PRISM Climate Group](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/notices/notice_20250327.php) data from [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) with our custom-built open-source software.
