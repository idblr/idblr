I co-authored an article in the [*Journal of the National Cancer Institute*](https://academic.oup.com/jnci) entitled ["Associations of self-identified race and ethnicity and genetic ancestry with mortality among cancer survivors"](https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaf066) led by [Dr. Jacqueline Vo](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8891-4437) and [Dr. Derek Brown](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8393-1713). We studied self-identified race and ethnicity (SIRE) and genetic ancestry in the [Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial](https://prevention.cancer.gov/major-programs/prostate-lung-colorectal-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-trial-plco). We found that SIRE and genetic ancestry do not solely reflect biologic variation; rather, social factors may drive mortality differences by SIRE and genetic ancestry. This project was funded, in-part, by our [2021 William G. Coleman Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Innovation Award](/post/coleman-2021).
