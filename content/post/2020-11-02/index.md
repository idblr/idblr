I received a [William G. Coleman Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Innovation Award](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/programs/intramural/research-award/index.html) from the [National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/) for a joint research proposal entitled ["HDoCS in PLCO: Health Disparities of Cancer Survivors in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial."](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/programs/intramural/research-award/2021-awardees/awardees-group.html) I join a stellar team of three co-awardees [Jacqueline Vo, Ph.D., R.N., M.P.H.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/reb/vo-jacqueline), [Naoise Synnott, Ph.D., M.P.H.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/iteb/synnott-naoise), and [Derek Brown, Ph.D., M.S.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/iteb/brown-derek) who are [NCI Cancer Prevention Fellows](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) in the intramural [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/). NIMHD designed this competitive award to support the development of innovative research ideas and concepts contributed by post-doctoral fellows within the [NIH Intramural Research Program](https://irp.nih.gov/) who have the potential for high impact in any area of minority health and health disparities research.
