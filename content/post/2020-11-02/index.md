I received a [William G. Coleman Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Innovation Award](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/programs/intramural/research-innovation-award/2021-awardees/awardees-group.html) from the [National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/) (NIMHD) for a joint research proposal entitled ["HDoCS in PLCO: Health Disparities of Cancer Survivors in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial."](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/programs/intramural/research-innovation-award/2021-awardees/awardees-group.html) I join a stellar team of three co-awardees [Dr. Jacqueline Vo](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8891-4437), [Dr. Naoise Synnott](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8331-1143), and [Dr. Derek Brown](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8393-1713) who are also [NCI Cancer Prevention Fellows](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) in the intramural [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/). NIMHD designed this competitive award to support the development of innovative research ideas and concepts contributed by post-doctoral fellows within the [NIH Intramural Research Program](https://irp.nih.gov/) who have the potential for high impact in any area of minority health and health disparities research.
