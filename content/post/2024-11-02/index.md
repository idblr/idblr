I first authored an article in [*Spatial and Spatio-temporal Epidemiology*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/spatial-and-spatio-temporal-epidemiology) entitled ["Multiple 'spaces': using wildlife surveillance, climatic variables, and spatial satitics to identify and map a climatic niche for endemic plague in California"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2024.100696). We estimated plague-suitable local climates and mapped them in California using coyotes (*Canis latrans*) tested for plague exposure by the [California Department of Public Health - Vector-Bourne Disease Section](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/VBDS.aspx). We applied spatial point processes within a space composed to two principal components of a principal component analysis of [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) [PRISM Climate Group](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/) 30-year average climate variables. The analysis was conducted using the [*envi*](https://cran.r-project.org/package=envi) package in R that I [previously published](/post/cran-envi). This is the first publication from my doctoral dissertation research.
