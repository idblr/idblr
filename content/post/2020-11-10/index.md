My second R package is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) named [gateR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gateR). It estimates clustering of cytometry cells using markers and the spatial relative risk function via the [sparr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sparr) package. See the public [Github repository](https://github.com/Waller-SUSAN/gateR) for more details.
