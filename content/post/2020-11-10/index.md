My second R package is published in the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) named [*gateR*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gateR). It estimates clustering of cytometry cells using markers and the spatial relative risk function via the [*sparr*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sparr) package. See the public [Github repository](https://github.com/lance-waller-lab/gateR) for more details.
