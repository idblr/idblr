I co-authored an article in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org) entitled ["Burkitt lymphoma risk shows geographic and temporal associations with _Plasmodium falciparum_ infections in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya"](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2211055120) led by [Kelly Broen](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2220-4026) and [Sam Mbulaiteye](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8273-9831). We used high-resolution long-term serial malaria exposure data (2000-2017; 5km resolution) and granular pediatric endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) case data from the [EMBLEM study](https://emblem.cancer.gov) (2010-2016) across regions of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda to find geographic, temporal, and age-related associations between lifetime exposure to _Plasmodium falciparum_ and eBL risk. Our findings suggest that malaria reduction may substantially reduce eBL incidence and mortality. You can find the [R langauge](https://cran.r-project.org/) scripts for the manuscript analysis in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/broenk/eBL).
