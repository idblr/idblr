[Derek Brown, Ph.D., M.S.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/iteb/brown-derek) and I received a Trans-Fellowship Research Award from the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention [Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) to supplement our [2020 DCEG Informatics Tool Challenge Award](/post/tools). The award ($17,000) will be used to complete the development of our "Spatial Power" webtool for the NCI [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/) and fund enhancements such as, for example, a Geographic Information System interface to see the calculated results displayed on an interactive map.

**Update**: [Spatial Power](https://analysistools.cancer.gov/spatial-power) was successfully launched on May 20, 2021
