I co-authored an article in [*Environmental Research*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/environmental-research) entitled ["Urinary nitrate and sodium in a high-risk area for upper gastrointestinal cancers: Golestan Cohort Study"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.113906) led by [Dr. Arash Etemadi](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3458-1072). We found urinary nitrate was associated with living at a higher elevation and using groundwater for drinking and a positive correlation between median urinary nitrate and sodium and esophageal cancer incidence rates in a rural population in northeastern Iran. My contribution included testing the data for spatial autocorrelation, evaluating elevation and precipitation, formulating the random intercept model, and consulting on the design of Figure 1. This is my first career international study and first international study as a [Cancer Prevention Fellow](https://cpfp.cancer.gov/) at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/).
