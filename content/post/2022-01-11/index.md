I received an annual Career Development Award from the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) (NCI) Director Intramural Innovation Award Program that is designed to support development of highly innovative approaches and technology aimed at significant cancerâ€“related problems. Winning proposals showed potential for significant scientific or public health impact, as well as approach, innovation, and programmatic relevance to the mission of the NCI [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/) (DCEG). Recipients will use their award in fiscal year 2022 with an upper limit of $15,000. Four other fellows and staff scientists within DCEG received an award.
