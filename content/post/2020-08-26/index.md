I am presenting my abstract entitled "Geographic variation in the oral microbiome of NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study Participants" at the [32nd Annual Conference of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology](https://isee2020virtual.org/) held virtually due to the global [SARC-CoV-2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) pandemic. I am also a coauthor on an abstract entitled "Ingestion of nitrate and nitrite from drinking water and diet and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in Iowa women" led by [Dr. Mary Ward](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/ward-mary).
