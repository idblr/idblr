[Catchment Areas of NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](https://gis.cancer.gov/ncicatchment/) is a web-based application that serves as a visualization tool for the geographically defined catchment areas of NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, providing a geographic scope for:
  * monitoring cancer trends
  * identifying pronounced socioeconomic- and health-related disparities
  * informing high-impact translational science
  * guiding the implementation of evidence-based interventions in clinical and community settings

The web application will continue to evolve, geographically linking Cancer Centersâ€™ catchment areas to publicly available data sources to aggregate sociodemographic and epidemiologic characteristics across the [NCI Cancer Centers Program](https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/). I co-led the tool development with [Peter DelNero, PhD, MPH](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8149-9004) with guidance from [Zaria Tatalovich, PhD, MA, GISP](https://surveillance.cancer.gov/about/bios/tatalovichz.html) and [Robin Vanderpool, DrPH](https://staffprofiles.cancer.gov/brp/prgmStaffProfile.do?contactId=33399217&name=Robin-Vanderpool&bioType=stf) and technical assistance from [Information Management Services, Inc.](https://www.imsweb.com/)
