I co-instructed a [workshop](https://epiresearch.org/annual-meeting/2024-meeting/2024-workshops/) at the [Society for Epidemiologic Research](https://epiresearch.org/) [Annual Meeting 2024](https://epiresearch.org/annual-meeting/2024-meeting/) entitled "Gitâ€™n up to speed on versioning control." The workshop was an introduction to the Git language and other Git-enabled technology for epidemiologists to version control their software code. I developed the course with other DLHers, including [Dr. Ghassan Hamra](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6921-5742), [Dr. Nat Macnell](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8748-2692), and Audrey Brown.

I was also a co-author on a [poster abstract](https://epiresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Book-Cover-and-Abstract.pdf) entitled "Revisiting the modifiable areal unit problem in the era of exposome-wide association studies: Assessing the performance of the CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index at privacy-protecting spatial scales" led by [Jonathan Lewis](https://orcid.org/0009-0008-0025-7435).
