I first authored an article in the [International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph) entitled ["Ingestion of Nitrate and Nitrite and Risk of Stomach and Other Digestive System Cancers in the Iowa Womenâ€™s Health Study"](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136822). We assessed risk of certain digestive cancers and ingestion of nitrate and nitrite from diet and drinking water in a prospective cohort of post-menopausal women in Iowa, USA. This is my first epidemiologic analysis for the [Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/oeeb) at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/).
