My third R package is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) named [gateR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=envi). It estimates the ecological niche using presence/absence data and the spatial relative risk function via the [sparr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sparr) package. See the public [Github repository](https://github.com/Waller-SUSAN/envi) for more details.

Thanks to major contributions from Dr. [Lance Waller](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=lance-waller-345).
