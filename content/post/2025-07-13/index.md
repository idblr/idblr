I co-authored an article in [*Frontiers in Public Health*](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health) entitled ["Descriptive analysis of municipal policies addressing shade in eight southwest and northeast states in the United States"](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1565251) led by [Dr. David Buller](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7902-9129). We assessed the municipal codes, planning documents, and manuals/guidelines from n=48 municipalities in eight states across the northeastern and southwestern U.S. We found that many municipalities had policies that mentioned shade, but only a few had policies that indicated their purpose was sun or heat protection.
