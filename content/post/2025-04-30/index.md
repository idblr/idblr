I co-authored an article in [*Cancer Research*](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres) entitled ["Integration of Germline and Somatic Variation Improves Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Risk Stratification"](https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-24-4251) led by [Dr. Aubrey Hubbard](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4052-1110). We investigated whether inclusion of a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-associated polygenic score and two common types of clonal hematopoiesis (i.e., autosomal mosaic chromosomal alterations and clonal hematopoiesis indeterminate potential), could improve CLL risk stratification in the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/). We also replicated our investigation in the [Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial](https://prevention.cancer.gov/major-programs/prostate-lung-colorectal-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-trial-plco). We obtained enhanced ability to identify individuals at high risk of CLL when integrating germline and somatic data derived from peripheral blood.
