I co-authored an article in [*Environmental Research*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/environmental-research) entitled ["Ambient air pollution in critical windows of exposure and spontaneous miscarriage in a preconception cohort"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121965) led by [Dr. Anne Marie Jukic](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8635-9505). We assessed the potential relationship between ambient air pollution and risk of spontaneous pregnancy loss for participants within the [Time to Conceive](https://www.med.unc.edu/timetoconceive/) study. We linked the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/) (EPA) [Community Multi-Scale Air Quality](https://www.epa.gov/cmaq) model (CMAQ) and [Fused Air Quality Surface Using Downscaling](https://www.epa.gov/hesc/rsig-related-downloadable-data-files) model for ambient air pollutant concentrations during multiple exposure windows during conception cycles to participant residential addresses at study enrollment. We found that residing in areas with higher ozone concentrations were associated with a small increase in spontaneous pregnancy loss risk. Ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide had stronger associations with spontaneous pregnancy loss risk among those with low vitamin D. Mixtures of ambient air pollutants were weakly associated with spontaneous pregnancy loss risk.
