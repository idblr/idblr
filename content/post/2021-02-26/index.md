I co-first authored an article in the [International Journal of Health Geographics](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/) entitled ["sparrpowR: a flexible R package to estimate statistical power to identify spatial clustering of two groups and its application"](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-021-00267-z). The article 
introduces the open-source R package [sparrpowR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sparrpowR) and demonstrates how it can be used to calculate statistical power for the spatial relative risk function for etiologic and surveillance research questions. [Derek Brown, Ph.D., M.S.](https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/iteb-fellows#derek-brown-phd-postdoctoral-fellow) is my fellow co-first author. See my [earlier post](/post/cran-sparrpowr/) about the [sparrpowR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sparrpowR) package that we co-developed.
