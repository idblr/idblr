I presented a lightning talk at the [American Geophysical Union](https://www.agu.org/) [Annual Meeting 2024](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting-2024) entitled "Ambient PM2.5 exposure and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a large U.S.-based cohort." I presented initial results from a project conducted by [Inam Ghulamhussain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inam-ghulamhussain) who I mentored while I was a postdoctoral [Cancer Prevention Fellow](https://prevention.cancer.gov/research-areas/networks-consortia-programs/cpfp) and he was a [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/) [Summer Intern](https://www.training.nih.gov/) at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/).
