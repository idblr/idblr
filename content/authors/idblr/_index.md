I received a Ph.D. in [Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/eh/degree-programs/phd/index.html) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu) (Advisor: [Dr. Lance Waller](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=345)) after completing a concurrent B.A./M.A. in [Ecology and Evolutionary Biolgy](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/) from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) (Advisor: [Dr. Pieter Johnson](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/pieter-johnson)). My [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/ian.buller.2/bibliography/public/) has been published in [Ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19399170), [International Journal of Health Geographics](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/), and [International Journal of Environmental Research and Health](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph).
