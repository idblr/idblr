I received a PhD in [Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/eh/degree-programs/phd/index.html) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu) (Advisor: [Lance Waller, PhD](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5002-8886)) after completing a concurrent BA/MA in [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/) from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu) (Advisor: [Pieter Johnson, PhD](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7997-5390)).
