Originally from the mountains of Jefferson County, Colorado, I attended the [Unversity of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu) studying disease ecology with [Dr. Pieter Johnson](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/pieter-johnson) where I received a [Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/) and graduated with highest honors. I then moved to Atlanta, Georgia and received a Ph.D. from [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu) in Environmental Health Sciences with [Dr. Lance Waller](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=345) with funding from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201). I am now a postdoctoral researcher at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov) through the [Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program](http://cpfp.cancer.gov) working with Drs. [Rena Jones](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/jones-rena) and [Mary Ward](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/ward-mary) in the [Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/programs-ebp/oeeb) in the [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/). 

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0001-9477-8582) focuses on the spatial and environmental epidemiology of cancer and infectious disease, including novel applications of spatial point pattern analyses. You can follow my research *in progress* on my [GitHub](https://github.com/idblr). I have written a scientific [publication](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QajtftEAAAAJ&hl=en) and have presented my research at numerous scientific conferences. I am a *ad hoc* reviewer for [Cancer Causes & Control](https://www.springer.com/journal/10552), [Methods in Ecology and Evoluation](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210X), and [PLoS - Neglected Tropical Diseases](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/).
