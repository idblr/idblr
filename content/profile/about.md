Originally from the mountains of Jefferson County, Colorado, I attended the [Unversity of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu) studying infectious disease ecology with [Pieter Johnson, PhD](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7997-5390) where I received a [Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org) and graduated with highest honors. I then moved to Atlanta, Georgia and received a PhD from [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu) in Environmental Health Sciences with [Lance Waller, PhD](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5002-8886) and funding from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov) [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=6201). I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov) through the [Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program](https://cpfp.cancer.gov) working with [Rena Jones, PhD, MS](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1294-1679) and [Mary Ward, PhD](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7584-8856) in the [Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/oeeb) in the [Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov) in Rockville, Maryland. I am now an Epidemiologist at [DLH, LLC](https://www.dlhcorp.com) (formerly known as Social and Scientific Systems, Inc.), in Bethesda, Maryland.

My [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/ian.buller.1/bibliography/public) focuses on the (geo)spatial and environmental epidemiology of cancer and infectious disease. You can follow my research *in progress* on my [GitHub](https://github.com/idblr). I have written scientific [publications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/ian.buller.1/bibliography/public) and have presented my research at numerous scientific conferences. I am an *ad hoc* reviewer for [Annals of Epidemiology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/annals-of-epidemiology), [Cancer Causes & Control](https://www.springer.com/journal/10552), [Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/), [Environmental Research](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-research), [International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph), [International Journal of Health Geographics](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/), [Methods in Ecology and Evoluation](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210X), [PLoS - Neglected Tropical Diseases](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds), and [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep).
